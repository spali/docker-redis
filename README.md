# Introduction
Dockerfile to build a redis container image which can be linked to other containers.

# Installation

Pull the latest version of the image from the docker index. This is the recommended method of installation as it is easier to update image in the future. These builds are performed by the **Docker Trusted Build** service.

```
docker pull spali/redis:latest
```

Alternately you can build the image yourself.

```
git clone https://github.com/spali/docker-redis.git
cd docker-redis
docker build -t="$USER/redis" .
```

# Quick Start
Run the redis image

```
docker run -name redis -d spali/redis:latest
```

To test if the redis server is configured properly, try connecting to the server.

```
redis-cli -h $(docker inspect --format {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} redis)
```

# Configuration

## Data Store
You should mount a volume at /var/lib/redis.

```
mkdir -p /opt/redis
docker run -name redis -d \
  -v /opt/redis/data:/var/lib/redis spali/redis:latest
```

This will make sure that the data stored in the database is not lost when the image is stopped and started again.

# Upgrading

To upgrade to newer releases, simply follow this 3 step upgrade procedure.

- **Step 1**: Stop the currently running image

```
docker stop redis
```

- **Step 2**: Update the docker image.

```
docker pull spali/redis:latest
```

- **Step 3**: Start the image

```
docker run -name redis -d [OPTIONS] spali/redis:latest
```
